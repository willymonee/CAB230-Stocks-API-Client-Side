# CAB230 (Web Computing)-Stocks-API-Client-Side-Application

The purpose of the stock client application is to allow users to view and filter a list of stocks, select a stock and view quote information, and select quote information from a series of dates. The application draws its data from a database through REST API queries. The application was produced using React and nodeJS.

**Instructions**
This project can no longer be run as the REST API was hosted on a server behind the QUT firewall with remote access via the QUT VPN. However, the project files can still be downloaded and there is also a video demo below. 
The report provides more detail/specificiation about the project.
